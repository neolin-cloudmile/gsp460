##Configure privatenet
## Create a new configuration and define privatenet.

1. Name the new file privatenet.tf in the tfnet folder, and then open it:

cd tfnet
vi privatenet.tf

2. Add the VPC network by copying the following code into privatenet.tf:

# Create privatenet network
resource "google_compute_network" "privatenet" {
  name                    = "privatenet"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

3. Add the privatesubnet-us subnet resource to privatenet.tf:

# Create privatesubnet-us subnetwork
resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "privatesubnet-us" {
  name          = "privatesubnet-us"
  region        = "us-central1"
  network       = "${google_compute_network.privatenet.self_link}"
  ip_cidr_range = "172.16.0.0/24"
}

4. Add the privatesubnet-eu subnet resource to privatenet.tf:

# Create privatesubnet-eu subnetwork
resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "privatesubnet-eu" {
  name          = "privatesubnet-eu"
  region        = "europe-west1"
  network       = "${google_compute_network.privatenet.self_link}"
  ip_cidr_range = "172.20.0.0/24"
}

##Configure the fire rule
## Define a firewall rule to allow HTTP, SSH, and RDP traffic on privatenet.

1. Add the firewall resource to privatenet.tf:

# Create a firewall rule to allow HTTP, SSH, RDP and ICMP traffic on privatenet
resource "google_compute_firewall" "privatenet-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp" {
  name    = "privatenet-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp"
  network = "${google_compute_network.privatenet.self_link}"
  allow {
      protocol = "tcp"
      ports    = ["22", "80", "3389"]
  }
  allow {
      protocol = "icmp"
  }  
}

##Configure the VM instance
## Use the instance module to configure privatenet-us-vm.

1. Add the VM instance resource to privatenet.tf:

# Add the privatenet-us-vm instance
module "privatenet-us-vm" {
  source           = "./instance"
  instance_name    = "privatenet-us-vm"
  instance_zone    = "us-central1-a"
  instance_subnetwork = "${google_compute_subnetwork.privatesubnet-us.self_link}"
}

##Create privatenet and its resources
## It's time to apply the privatenet configuration.

1. Rewrite the Terraform configurations files to a canonical format and style by running the following command:

terraform fmt

2. Initialize Terraform by running the following command:

terraform init

3. Create an execution plan by running the following command:

terraform plan

4. Apply the desired changes by running the following command:

terraform apply

5. Confirm the planned actions by typing:

yes

##Verify privatenet and its resources
## In the GCP Console, verify that the resources were created.

1. In the GCP Console, select Navigation menu > VPC network > VPC networks. View the privatenet VPC network with its subnetworks.
2. In the left pane, click VPC network > Firewall Rules. View the privatenet_allow_http_ssh_rdp_icmp firewall rule for the VPC network that was created.
3. Select Navigation menu > Compute Engine > VM instances. Note the internal IP addresses for privatenet-us-vm.
4. For managementnet-us-vm, click SSH to launch a terminal and connect.
5. To test connectivity to privatenet-us-vm's internal IP address, run the following command in the SSH terminal (replacing privatenet-us-vm's internal IP address with the value noted earlier)
